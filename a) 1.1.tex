As long as two electrons has opposite spin, they can exist in the same state. Their energy is given by $$\epsilon_{n_x,n_y} = (n_x + n_y + 1)\omega$$ The energy of the ground state for two electrons without interaction, is simply the sum of the energies:  $\epsilon_{n_x,n_y} = 2\times (0 + 0 + 1) =  2\omega$. 

The wavefunction for the unpartubated stystem is given by
$$
\Phi (\mathbf{r_1}, \mathbf{r_2} ) = C \exp{[-\frac{\omega}{2}(\mathbf{r_1}^2 + \mathbf{r_2}^2)]}
$$
where $\mathbf{r_i} = \sqrt{r{i_x}^2 + r_{i_y}^2}$.  The total spin in the ground state is simply zero as the two electrons living in the state is pared with opposite spins (eg. $\pm 1/2$).
