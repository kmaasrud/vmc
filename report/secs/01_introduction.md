# Introduction

<!-- Something about quantum /system-->
Quantum dots are concidered as point particles with confiend electrons, usualy exisiting in semiconductor materials, with different electrical and optical properties compared to its host. The difference in properties are du to quantum mechanical effects, yielding quantification of the energy of the system. The technology is utilized in photovoltaic devices to enhance performance, in LED's, photodetectors and more. 

<!-- Something what we have done -->

This paper presents a numerical study of such quantum dots confined in a Harmonic Osccilator potential. The system in question consist of closed shell configurations, from two to 20 electrons. The energy of the ground state is calculated using variatonal Monte Carlo, where a set of parameters are optimized in order to obtain accurate calculations as possible. For the simplest system (??) the numerical results are compared to analytical calculations.

The report first gives an overview of the theoretical background of the system and the methods. Derivation of the analytical expressions for the simplest system are presented, in order to give a benchmark to which we can compare the perfomance and accuracy  of our numerical solver. Thereafter we present the methodology behind our numerical solver. Then the results from the calculations are presented, before a discussion and **suggestions for futre work** are given. Hideous calculations and notation are presented in Appendix.
