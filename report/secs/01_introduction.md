# Introduction

<!-- Something about quantum /system-->
Quantum dots are considered as point particles with confined electrons, usually existing in semiconductor materials, with different electrical and optical properties compared to its host. The difference in properties is due to quantum mechanical effects, yielding quantification of the energy of the system. The technology is utilized in photovoltaic devices to enhance performance, in LED's, photodetectors and more. 

<!-- Something what we have done -->

This paper presents a numerical study of such quantum dots confined in a Harmonic Oscillator potential. The system in question consists of closed shell configurations, from two to 20 electrons. The energy of the ground state is calculated using Variational Monte Carlo, where a set of parameters are optimized to obtain accurate calculations as possible. For the simplest system (??) the numerical results are compared to analytical calculations.

The report first gives an overview of the theoretical background of the system and the methods. Derivation of the analytical expressions for the simplest system are presented, to give a benchmark to which we can compare the performance and accuracy of our numerical solver. Thereafter we present the methodology behind our numerical solver. Then the results from the calculations are presented before a discussion and **suggestion for future work** are given. Hideous calculations and notation are presented in Appendix.
