# Introduction

<!-- Something about quantum /system-->

Quantum dots are considered as point particles with confined electrons, usually existing in semiconductor materials, with different electrical and optical properties in relation with its host. The difference in properties is due to quantum mechanical effects, yielding quantification of the energy of the system. This technology can be utilized in photovoltaic devices to enhance performance, in LED's, photodetectors and more.

<!-- Something what we have done -->

This paper presents a numerical study of such quantum dots, confined in a harmonic oscillator potential. The system in question consists of closed shell configurations, from $N = 2$ to $N = 12$ electrons. The energy of the ground state is calculated using the variational Monte Carlo method, where a set of variational parameters describing a trial wave function are optimized to obtain the lowest energy. For the simplest system the numerical results are compared to analytical calculations.

The report first gives an overview of the theoretical background of the system and the methods. The derivations of the analytical expressions for the simplest system are presented, to give a benchmark unto which we can compare the performance and accuracy of our numerical solver. Thereafter we present the methodology behind our numerical solver. Lastly, the results from our calculations are presented, followed by a discussion of them. Larger derivations are shown in the appendix.
