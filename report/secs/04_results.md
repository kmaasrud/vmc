## Performance evaluation of different energy calculation methods{#sec:results-performance-calc-methods}

The performance of the analytical expression for the local energy,numerical derivation of the kinetic energy and the analytical local energy with importance sampling is compared in table [@tab:results-performance-calc-methods] below.

| **Calculation method**            | **Time spent (s)**    |
| ----:                             | ---                   |
| Analytical                        | $time$                |
| Numerical                         | $time$                |
| Analytical w/Importance Sampling  | $time$                |{#tab:results-performance-calc-methods} 

The blocking analysis shows that the optimal standard deviation is $FILL$.

## Evaluating the variational parameters{#sec:results-variational-params}

The VMC approximation to the correct energy dependent on the variational parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are shown in the figures below.
