## Hermite polynomials

The Hermite polynomials are given by the following sequence

$$ H_n(x) = c_{n + m}x^n + c_{n-1 + m}x^{n-1}... + c_{m}x^0, \qquad m = \sum_{i=1}^n i$$

where the coefficients $c_n$ are given by the triangle sequence shown below [@Jovovic2001]:

$$c_i = 1, 0, 2, -2, 0, 4, 0, -12, 0, 8, 12, 0, -48, ...$$
