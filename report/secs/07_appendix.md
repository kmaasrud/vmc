## Hermite polynomials {#sec:hermite}

The Hermite polynomials are given by the following sequence

$$ H_n(x) = c_{n + m}x^n + c_{n-1 + m}x^{n-1}... + c_{m}x^0, \qquad m = \sum_{i=1}^n i$$

where the coefficients $c_n$ are given by the triangle sequence shown below [@Jovovic2001]:

$$c_i = 1, 0, 2, -2, 0, 4, 0, -12, 0, 8, 12, 0, -48, ...$$

## Analytical Laplace of the Trial wavefunction

The trial wavefunction of a two-particle system is

$$ \Psi_T (\mathbf{r_1}, \mathbf{r_2}) = \Psi_1  * \Psi_2 = C \exp{(-\alpha \omega (r_1^2 + r_2^2)/2)} \exp{\left( \frac{ar_{12}}{1 + \beta r_{12}}\right)} $$

as defined in theory section {@sec:theo_local-enery}.

The Laplacian is the double derivative in all dimensions, defined as:

$$
\Delta f=\frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial y^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial z^{2}}
$$

The calculations:
