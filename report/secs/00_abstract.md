# Abstract

Rust is used to develop a ground state solver for fermionic systems in an harmoic oscillator potential, utilizing the variational principle,  Monte Carlo integration and two different implementations of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The results are compared with analytical solutions to the corresponding systems. 

<!-- Highlight some of the results quantitativly - eg the effect of the Jastrow factor --> 
The effect of the socalled Jastrow factor shows a **increse/decrease** on energies, onebody densities and ...  at **these conditions - eg system N = 2** and **this result** on the higher number of particles.
