# Conclusion

<!-- Summerize what we have done--> 

<!-- Say something about the different performance of Brute force vs. Importance sampling--> 

<!-- Comment on what happens using a higher number of particles - time, algorithms, problems, accuracy--> 

<!-- Say something about the variational parameters (using two instead of one)--> 

<!-- Effect of the Jastrow factor: particle distance, one-body density, energy --> 

<!-- Effect of the interaction /pertubation: energy, distance?,  one-body density if we have calculated it--> 

<!-- Dependency of different frequencies --> 

<!-- Optimization --> 

<!-- Future work/improvements  - important -->
