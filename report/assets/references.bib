	abstract = {We present an efficient low-rank updating algorithm for updating the trial wavefunctions used in Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. The algorithm is based on low-rank updating of the Slater determinants. In particular, the computational complexity of the algorithm is O(kN) during the k-th step compared with traditional algorithms that require O(N{\textasciicircum}2) computations, where N is the system size. For single determinant trial wavefunctions the new algorithm is faster than the traditional O(N{\textasciicircum}2) Sherman-Morrison algorithm for up to O(N) updates. For multideterminant configuration-interaction type trial wavefunctions of M+1 determinants, the new algorithm is significantly more efficient, saving both O(MN{\textasciicircum}2) work and O(MN{\textasciicircum}2) storage. The algorithm enables more accurate and significantly more efficient QMC calculations using configuration interaction type wavefunctions.},
